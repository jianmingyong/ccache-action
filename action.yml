      from GH Releases instead of compiling from source. If binary is not

  cache-dir:
    description:
      'This option specifies where ccache will keep its cached compiler outputs.'
    default: '.ccache'

  compiler-check:
    description:
      'By default, ccache includes the modification time (“mtime”) and size of
      the compiler in the hash to ensure that results retrieved from the cache
      are accurate. If compiler plugins are used, these plugins will also be
      added to the hash. This option can be used to select another strategy.'
    default: 'mtime'

  compression:
    description:
      'If true, ccache will compress data it puts in the cache. However, this
      option has no effect on how files are retrieved from the cache; compressed
      and uncompressed results will still be usable regardless of this option.
      The default is true. Compression is done using the Zstandard algorithm.
      The algorithm is fast enough that there should be little reason to turn
      off compression to gain performance. One exception is if the cache is
      located on a compressed file system, in which case the compression
      performed by ccache of course is redundant.'
    default: 'true'

  compression-level:
    description:
      'This option determines the level at which ccache will compress object
      files using the real-time compression algorithm Zstandard. It only has
      effect if compression is enabled (which it is by default). Zstandard is
      extremely fast for decompression and very fast for compression for lower
      compression levels. The default is 0.'
    default: '0'

    description:
      'This option specifies the maximum number of files to keep in the cache.

      The default value is 5G. Available suffixes: k, M, G, T (decimal) and Ki,
      Mi, Gi, Ti (binary). The default suffix is G.'
    default: '500M'

  sloppiness:
    description:
      "By default, ccache tries to give as few false cache hits as possible.
      However, in certain situations it's possible that you know things that
      ccache can't take for granted. This option makes it possible to tell
      ccache to relax some checks in order to increase the hit rate."
